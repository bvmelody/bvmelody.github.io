Linear organization is the concept of arranging a website in such a way that
you can simply go from one website to another in a line. So you could go to web page 1 from web
page 5 by passing through web pages 2-4. In addition if you wanted to go back to page 1 you would
need to go back through pages 2-4.

Random organization is style of not having a traditional heirarchical or linear organization to a website.
While this may seem unorganized it an also be very deliberately designed in such a way. For example a web
based game such as an alternate reality game may have a person go to seemingly random web pages that work
together to form a cohesive gameplay and narrative experience.

In my opinion using a linear organization for these web pages in this assignment was the best choice
as all of the pages are strikingly familiar and understandable to the user, and it made it easy
for customers to understand how to navigate the web page without explanatoin.
