            This is the easiest collectible to display in my opinion, especially since they stick to nearly anything.
            I've been collecting stickers for arguably the shortest amount of time, but compared to the other two it
            is the absolute easiest to start collecting and getting a large collection quickly! Stickers are commonly
            given away for free at outreach events, networking, job fairs, and all sorts of other places/events! It's
            not uncommon for people in IT to have their entire machine decked out in all sorts of nerdy stickers!

        <h3>Why should you collect stickers?</h3>
        <p>
            Stickers are arguably the easiest of the three examples to collect.  Being cheap to produce
            and widely available whether as freebees or for purchase! They are also rather easy to slap
            onto nearly anything from clothing to notebooks. It's also much easier to purchase custom
            stickers than a custom enamel pin or a custom patch.
