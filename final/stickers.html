        <h1>Stickers!</h1>
        <p>
            This is the easiest collectible to display in my opinion, especially since they stick to nearly anything.
            I've been collecting stickers for arguably the shortest amount of time, but compared to the other two it
            is the absolute easiest to start collecting and getting a large collection quickly! Stickers are commonly
            given away for free at outreach events, networking, job fairs, and all sorts of other places/events! It's
            not uncommon for people in IT to have their entire machine decked out in all sorts of nerdy stickers!
