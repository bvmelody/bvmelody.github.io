        <h1>Why Collect?</h1>
        <p>
            Collecting anything can be both a obtuse mess, expensive, and often times can require a lot of space.
            For many this can be both a blessing and a curse, after all, collecting anything can provide a creative outlet
            and a way to spend one's time in short bursts over a long period. But one thing I've noticed during my time is
            that some forms of collecting are more practical for some people than others. For example, my hallmark, pin trading
            is incredibly practical to my needs. Mainly that it is inexpensive compared to other things, and is very easy to
            show it off. But in many ways I have expanded since then, now starting a sticker collection and even an embroidery
            patch collection.
