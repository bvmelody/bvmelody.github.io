            These are the collectible that are the best for fabrics, especially if
            you are really into music. Patches have been around for centuries, first primarily
            as a way to help mend clothing holes, especially large ones, by adding a new strip
            of fabric over top of said hole.
            <br>
            <br>
            Over time this allowed for new processes with cloth patches being used for
            unit and rank identification in militaries around the world, most notable starting
            in the world wars. From there it made the jump into niche music communities where
            punks would add band patches and cloth album covers to jackets in order to express
            themselves.
            <br>
            <br>
            From battle jackets to hats, from clothing repairs to artistic expression, patches are
            a huge part of our clothing culture today.

        <h1>Inexhaustive List of Patch Types</h1>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Patch Types</th>
                <th>Summary</th>
                <th>Difficulties</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Embroidery Patches</th>
                <th>Patches made with embroidery thread, and can be very simple designs or incredibly complicated.
                    They're also the most common type of patch available, with hundreds available online.
                </th>
                <th>
                    Wide variety of "applicators" or ways to put on a jacket, most difficult being sew on which requires
                    it to be either hand sewn or with a machine rather than easy application. Those with iron on backings
                    or velcro backings are much easier to work with, but are much harder to find regularly.
                </th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Chenille Patches</th>
                <th>Patches made with yarn to provide a unique texture to it, especially used on "Letter" patches
                    given out to students for their participation in extracuricular activities. Is the reason "Letterman"
                    jackets exist. Now exist in hundreds of variations especially on Etsy.
                </th>
                <th>
                    The letter patches only really work on letterman jackets in my opinion, and you need to earn those patches.
                    Custom patches though a fair game, but often custom made and expensive for your average person.
                </th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Rhinestone Patches</th>
                <th>Widely used in womens fashion for adding embellishments and pops of color/refleciton in clothing.
                    Look best on Jeans and denim.
                </th>
                <th>
                    Often a bit more difficult to find in a large variety online. Often are applied to clothing beforehand
                    rather than sold directly. Once again, Etsy is your best friend.
                </th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Sequin Patches</th>
                <th>
                    Very similar to rhinestone patches but using sequins instead. Look better on a larger variety of fabrics
                    in my opinion.
                </th>
                <th>
                    Easier to find in a wider variety of options online, and much easier to find them in a DIY state. However,
                    they are much more likely to be sew on only, requiring either hand sewing or a machine to do it properly.
                </th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>PVC Patches</th>
                <th>
                    The most durable types of patches, allow for bright colors or subdued for more practical uses by military/law
                    enforcement. Due to their design they can often have cool 3 Dimensional elements that are much more difficult
                    on other patch types.
                </th>
                <th>
                    Often only available in velcro or iron on, requiring either an iron or a item of clothing or display with velcro to attach it to.
                </th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Leather Patches</th>
                <th>
                    Another durable type of patch, though quite rare to find. They are commonly found on outdoor clothing brands to hold their logo on a jacket sleeve.
                    Starting to become more popular.
                </th>
                <th>
                    Quite hard to find custom made ones, and more expensive to have them created. Also can be difficult to work with unless you have an understanding
                    of leather working, which most people don't.

        <h3>military Patch Collections</h3>
        <details name="patches">
            <summary>National Patches</summary>
            <p>
                Easy to find and often mass produced for all military and law enforcement units. Perfectly okay to wear around
                as they are often worn by both military and civilian services or by your average overly-patriotic citizen.
            </p>
        </details>
        <details name="patches">
            <summary>Unit Patches</summary>
            <p>
                Can be difficult to find unless they are really famous units, or you have a connection to the active unit.
                You should be careful to not wear it and only display it on a wall display or something similar to prevent
                others from thinking you are stealing valor.
            </p>
        </details>
        <details name="patches">
            <summary>Mission Patches</summary>
            <p>
                Incredibly difficult to collect as they are made for a short time and only for the people and family of people
                who participated in the mission. This can be for everything from a military campaign to a testing program.
                Mostly made as PVC patches, but still incredibly difficult to find and collect properly.
