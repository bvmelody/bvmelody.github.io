        <h1>Patches!</h1>
        <p>
            These are the collectible that are the best for fabrics, especially if
            you are really into music. Patches have been around for centuries, first primarily
            as a way to help mend clothing holes, especially large ones, by adding a new strip
            of fabric over top of said hole.

            <br>
            Over time this allowed for new processes with cloth patches being used for
            unit and rank identification in militaries around the world, most notable starting
            in the world wars. From there it made the jump into niche music communities where
            punks would add band patches and cloth album covers to jackets in order to express
            themselves.
