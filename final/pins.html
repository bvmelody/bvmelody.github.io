        <h1>Pins!</h1>
        <p>
            My personal OG, the first things I started collecting, enamel pins! These are in my opinion the best option to start collecting as they are
            incredibly easy to find in decent quality! There are thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of unique pin designs around the world, so it
            is incredibly easy to find pins you would like to display! But there are a few things you should keep in mind! Mainly regarding Specific
            categories of pins that might have some unique qualities that may make them more complex and/or difficult to collect.
        </p>
        <h2>Hard Enamel vs Soft Enamel</h2>
        <p>Likely the most common qualifier you will see when pin collecting is whether a pin is hard or soft enamel.
            Now, what does this mean? Well it is rather simple and easy to tell the differenc between the two!

            <summary>Lapel Pins</summary>
            <p>
                A very common form of pin that is often sold in singles in stores. Named for the fact they
                are designed to be worn on a jacket lapel. Though it doesn't have to be. For instance I often
                wear a pin on my shirt collar or pocket. This category actually encompasses most pins as even
                those that I would never consider wearing on a lapel, will be called "lapel pins" on the packaging.
                This isn't a knock on them or false advertising, it's just a convenient name that most people
                will understand.

                <br>
                <br>

                It's also quite common the the United States to see
                politicians where an American Flag pin on their suit lapel, initially started by GOP candidates
                in the 1970 election, and would come to national attention thanks to Richard Nixon giving an
                order to all his staff to wear a flag pin in order to show their belief in their
                "silent majority". This trend would wane somewhat until the gulf war and 9/11 where the
                pins returned in force. Nowadays it's difficult to find politicians regularly going with the pin
                on the campaign trail.

            <summary>Disney Trading Pins</summary>
            <p>
                One of the most well known pin collections is the various official Disney Trading Pin series!
                While pins had always existed in the Disney parks, the official pin trading program wasn't.
                Initially started in 1999 for the Millenium Celebration, the Disney Pin Trading program has been
                operating ever since! Often with incredibly dedicated fans! Including myself!
                <br>
                <br>
                There are hundreds of collections available, from the huge variety of Disney Princess pins, to 
                the sheer number of Mickey Mouse pins. From the hundreds of Star Wars pins, to the early
                Hannah Montana Pins.

            <summary>Olympic Pins</summary>
            <p>
                For over 100 years the Olympic Games have been making pins for the games.
                While initially only for ease of identifying officials and organizers, has
                since become a phenomenon known as the "unofficial event" of the Olympics.
                The Olympic pin trading scene makes thousands of pins every year for the event,
                pins for specific olympians, nations, sports, etc. They are both a category
                that can be hard to collect when intially released, but can get progressively
                easier as te pins are slowly sold secondhand online. Or traded by those who
                went to the olympics.

            <summary>Eastern-Bloc Pins</summary>
            <p>
                Oh where to begin? Since the fall of the Eastern-Bloc in the early 90s the Pin
                collecting for that era has exploded. The nations that fell under the Soviet's
                control are well known for the insane number of pins that they produced during
                the era. For everything from civil service, military accolades, to even general
                public works and groups, there were pins for nearly everything. While of course
                you have the "lenin face on a red flag" that is so common it's near impossible
                to not find them, you also have pins that were only produced in limited numbers
                in only one country that can be hellish to find.
                <br>
                <br>
                There are two difficulties with collecting pins from this area of the world, and 
                time period of their societies. The first one being that shipping said pins
                halfway across the world can be incredibly expensive depending on which seller
                you are buying from. And with the new tariffs in effect, who knows how much those
                pins will be going for in a few months? The second issue is less practical and
                more personal. How many people will be put off by the fact that you collect these
                pins? Especially people who suffered under those regimes can be quite sensitive
                about the topic and just flat out stating "I collect these" can draw out responses
                that can be accurate in opinion, if misunderstanding the purpose. Needless to say,
                just remember not to be careful about making sure people understand you are collecting
                for the love of the game, rather than out of love for the regime.

            <summary>Government Pins</summary>
            <p>
                This is a category that is relatively easy to start collecting, but damn near impossible
                to get a full collection. There are thousands of pins issued to government employees
                as commemoration of their work or of their agency's history. Whether it be civil or military,
                these pins are widely known and relatively easy to collect. Though some are harder than others,
                especially pins that are no longer produced or are only given to members of the group they
                were made to commemorate, most famously smaller military units. I've heard of some enamel pins
                created to commemorate members of the seal teams, but I have yet to see an image of one.
                Needless to say I'd like to find one, and if you do find one, send us a pic on our about us page!
                We'd love to see it!

            <summary>Company Pins</summary>
            <p>
                Similar to government pins, these pins are given about by companies to their employees,
                typically commemorating a time period or department within said company. The most well known
                of these are the McDonald's employee pins which are given out to the staff of their restaurants
                for each new toy lineup. Everything from Toy Story to Pokemon, every franchise has a pin that has
                been at McDonald's.
                <br>
                <br>
                There's also many companies that give their higher ups pins of the company logo, such as CVS,
                where my coworker got one from a local area manager. Needless to say, I am extremely jealous.
                But who knows? Maybe I'll find one sometimes soon!

        <h3>What Should You Collect?</h3>
        <p>Honestly? Whatever you would like to! I started by purchasing two pins at a regional tournament!
            You don't need to collect the rarest, or the coolest pins! Just collect the pins that make you happy!
            But also, if you're looking for a particlar collection to start with, start trying to collect all of
            the pins in a random pin box that you can find in pop culture stores like Hot-Topic or BoxLunch!
            These are often affordable and gives you something to get a "full collection" of without spending
            as much up front!
