        <h1>Pins!</h1>
        <p>
            My personal OG, the first things I started collecting, enamel pins! These are in my opinion the best option to start collecting as they are
            incredibly easy to find in decent quality! There are thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of unique pin designs around the world, so it
            is incredibly easy to find pins you would like to display! But there are a few things you should keep in mind! Mainly regarding Specific
            categories of pins that might have some unique qualities that may make them more complex and/or difficult to collect.
