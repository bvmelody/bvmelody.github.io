        <h1>Pins!</h1>
        <p>
            My personal OG, the first things I started collecting, enamel pins! These are in my opinion the best option to start collecting as they are
            incredibly easy to find in decent quality! There are thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of unique pin designs around the world, so it
            is incredibly easy to find pins you would like to display! But there are a few things you should keep in mind! Mainly regarding Specific
            categories of pins that might have some unique qualities that may make them more complex and/or difficult to collect.
        </p>
        <h2>Hard Enamel vs Soft Enamel</h2>
        <p>Likely the most common qualifier you will see when pin collecting is whether a pin is hard or soft enamel.
            Now, what does this mean? Well it is rather simple and easy to tell the differenc between the two!

            <div class="content">
                <p>A very common form of pin that is often sold in singles in stores. Named for the fact they
                    are designed to be worn on a jacket lapel. Though it doesn't have to be. For instance I often
                    wear a pin on my shirt collar or pocket. This category actually encompasses most pins as even
                    those that I would never consider wearing on a lapel, will be called "lapel pins" on the packaging.
                    This isn't a knock on them or false advertising, it's just a convenient name that most people
                    will understand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's also quite common the the United States to see
                    politicians where an American Flag pin on their suit lapel, initially started by GOP candidates
                    in the 1970 election, and would come to national attention thanks to Richard Nixon giving an
                    order to all his staff to wear a flag pin in order to show their belief in their
                    "silent majority". This trend would wane somewhat until the gulf war and 9/11 where the
                    pins returned in force. Nowadays it's difficult to find politicians regularly going with the pin
                    on the campaign trail.

        <h3>What Should You Collect?</h3>
        <p>Honestly? Whatever you would like to! I started by purchasing two pins at a regional tournament!
            You don't need to collect the rarest, or the coolest pins! Just collect the pins that make you happy!
            But also, if you're looking for a particlar collection to start with, start trying to collect all of
            the pins in a random pin box that you can find in pop culture stores like Hot-Topic or BoxLunch!
            These are often affordable and gives you something to get a "full collection" of without spending
            as much up front!
